#  Food Waste Reduction Analysis 
# using Machine Learning and Data Analysis 

#IBM SKILLSBUILD INTERNSHIP PROJECT ; 
This project focuses on reducing food waste by leveraging data analysis and machine learning to predict potential food wastage in households based on various factors. By identifying patterns and important factors contributing to waste, this project aims to promote sustainable consumption and efficient food management practices.

# ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate household food waste based on lifestyle, storage methods, consumption behavior, and demographic data. This can help:
Raise awareness about food waste;
Provide insights into behaviors leading to food wastage;
Encourage better food planning and management.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The notebook includes detailed EDA:
Checking for missing/null values;
Visualizing key features using histograms and bar charts;
Analyzing food waste trends across different households and behaviors;
Encoding categorical variables for model processing.

# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models
Multiple machine learning models were used and compared to predict food waste:
Linear Regression;
Decision Tree Regressor;
Random Forest Regressor;
Support Vector Regression (SVR);
Gradient Boosting Regressor;

# ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE);
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE);
RÂ² Score;
Random Forest Regressor performed the best with the highest accuracy and lowest error.
